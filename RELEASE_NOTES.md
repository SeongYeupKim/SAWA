## 🚀 Major Release Highlights

### Complete Architecture Redesign
SAWA v2.0 represents a fundamental shift from rule-based pattern matching to **AI-driven evaluation**, following the advanced methodologies established in the GitHub SAWA research prototype.

### AI-Powered Evaluation System
- **Anthropic Claude Integration**: Primary AI evaluator using `claude-3-haiku-20240307`
- **OpenAI GPT-4 Support**: Fallback evaluation with `gpt-4o-mini`
- **Dynamic AI Client Loading**: Serverless-compatible initialization with environment detection
- **4-Level Assessment Scale**: Sophisticated scoring (1=Underdeveloped, 2=Developing, 3=Proficient, 4=Excellent)

### Enhanced Toulmin Framework Implementation
Six-stage argumentative writing progression:
1. **Claim**: Specific, contestable arguments with conditional language
2. **Evidence**: Quality evaluation criteria and source specification
3. **Reasoning**: Logical connections with warrant clarity
4. **Backing**: Academic support and theoretical grounding
5. **Qualifier**: Limitation acknowledgment and nuanced understanding
6. **Rebuttal**: Counterargument analysis and response strategies
