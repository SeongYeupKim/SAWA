# SAWA - Scientific Argumentative Writing Assistant

## ðŸŽ¯ **Complete Implementation of Your CER + Toulmin Framework**

I have now **completely rebuilt** the system to reflect your exact SAWA concepts and processes from the PDF. This is no longer a generic chatbot - it's your specific scientific argumentative writing assistant.

## âœ… **What's Now Implemented (Exactly from Your PDF)**

### **1. Core Framework**
- **CER (Claimâ€“Evidenceâ€“Reasoning)** as the core structure
- **Toulmin extensions** (Backing, Qualifier, Rebuttal)
- **6 sequential stages**: Claim â†’ Evidence â†’ Reasoning â†’ Backing â†’ Qualifier â†’ Rebuttal
- **Socratic questioning** with targeted prompts for each stage
- **4-level analytic rubric** (1=weak, 2=developing, 3=proficient, 4=advanced)

### **2. Socratic Questioning System**
- **One-move-at-a-time prompts** tied to specific argumentative roles
- **Explicit checks for completeness** before advancing
- **Minimal feedback phrased as "principled nudges"** when answers miss threshold
- **Immediate return to questions** after feedback

### **3. Evaluation & Feedback Logic**
- **Internal analytic rubric** with 4 levels per facet
- **Default behavior is questioning** - only pivots to feedback when below threshold
- **Preserves student agency** while preventing unproductive loops
- **Readiness gate**: Advance only when each facet reaches Level 3+ (proficient)

### **4. Prep Sheet Generation**
- **Concise prep sheet** with fields: Claim, Evidence Plan, Reasoning/Warrant, Backing, Qualifier, Rebuttal Plan
- **Student-owned statements** that can be copied into essays
- **Fixed structure** for clarity and consistency

### **5. Qualifier Patterns & Sentence Stems**
- **Certainty scale**: always â†’ almost always â†’ generally â†’ often â†’ sometimes â†’ rarely
- **Probability scale**: certainly â†’ very likely â†’ likely â†’ possible â†’ unlikely
- **Sentence stems** for qualified claims
- **Feedback triggers** for absolute language

### **6. Rebuttal Strategies**
- **4 response strategies**: Concede with boundary, Limit scope, Offer competing mechanism, Challenge credibility
- **Socratic prompts** to move beyond dismissive counters
- **Sentence stems** for professional rebuttals

### **7. Reasoning Schemes**
- **Causal/mechanistic reasoning**
- **Correlation reasoning**
- **Expert opinion reasoning**
- **Analogical reasoning**
- **Consequence reasoning**

## ðŸš€ **How to Test Your SAWA System**

### **Quick Test (No Database Required)**
```bash
# Install minimal dependencies
pip install fastapi uvicorn

# Run the SAWA test server
python test_sawa.py
```

Then visit: **http://localhost:8000/docs**

### **Full System with Database**
```bash
# Install all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up database and seed rubric
python scripts/seed_sawa_rubric.py

# Run the full system
python run_server.py
```

## ðŸ“‹ **API Endpoints (Your Exact Framework)**

### **Start SAWA Conversation**
```bash
POST /api/sawa/start
{
  "topic": "GMO safety"
}
```

### **Process Student Response**
```bash
POST /api/sawa/respond
{
  "conversation_id": 1,
  "content": "GMOs are generally safe for human consumption"
}
```

### **Get Rubric Information**
```bash
GET /api/sawa/rubric/claim
GET /api/sawa/rubric/evidence
GET /api/sawa/rubric/reasoning
GET /api/sawa/rubric/backing
GET /api/sawa/rubric/qualifier
GET /api/sawa/rubric/rebuttal
```

### **Get Reasoning Schemes**
```bash
GET /api/sawa/reasoning-schemes
GET /api/sawa/qualifier-patterns
GET /api/sawa/rebuttal-strategies
```

## ðŸ”„ **Example Conversation Flow**

1. **Start**: "What one-sentence position do you want to defend on this issue?"
2. **Student**: "GMOs are safe"
3. **SAWA**: "Could you add a condition that makes it more precise?"
4. **Student**: "GMOs are generally safe for human consumption"
5. **SAWA**: "What specific information will you use to support your claim?"
6. **Continue through all 6 stages...**
7. **Final**: Generate prep sheet with all responses

## ðŸ“Š **Rubric Implementation**

Each stage is evaluated using your exact 4-level rubric:

- **Level 1 (Weak)**: Below threshold, triggers feedback
- **Level 2 (Developing)**: Below threshold, triggers feedback  
- **Level 3 (Proficient)**: Meets threshold, advances to next stage
- **Level 4 (Advanced)**: Exceeds threshold, advances to next stage

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Features from Your PDF**

### **Boundaries & Safety**
- âœ… No co-writing or paragraph generation
- âœ… No invention of evidence beyond student proposals
- âœ… No style/grammar coaching (content-and-logic only)
- âœ… Transparent decline when asked for unverified evidence

### **Interaction Design**
- âœ… Fine interaction grain (one targeted question per turn)
- âœ… Limited branching to smallest necessary correction
- âœ… 12-18 turn typical completion
- âœ… Student-owned statements for prep sheet

### **Success Criteria**
- âœ… Declarative, arguable claim
- âœ… Evidence plan with source type + evaluation criterion
- âœ… Explicit warrant linking evidence to claim
- âœ… Named backing (theory/model/prior finding)
- âœ… Calibrated qualifier matching evidence strength
- âœ… Serious counterargument + response strategy
