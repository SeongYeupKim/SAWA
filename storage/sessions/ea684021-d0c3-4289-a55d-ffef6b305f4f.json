Can you rephrase your claim in a way that provides more context and substance for me to better understand your perspective?\"\n\nThis question aims to prompt the student to articulate their underlying thought or observation more clearly, without simply telling them what the \"right\" claim should be. The goal is to guide them towards formulating a clear, testable claim that you can then evaluate and discuss further.",
